## Overview
This project is a personal project I did with the purpose of improving my understanding of state management, concurrency primitives (refs, agents), and modular application structure. It is not intended for production use. However, if you wish to experiment with or extend this project, please see the instructions below.

## Features
- Account Management: Create, deposit, withdraw, and transfer funds between accounts.

- Concurrency: Uses Clojure's STM (ref, dosync) for safe, atomic operations.

- Audit Logging: All actions are logged asynchronously using Clojure agents.

- Interactive CLI: Terminal-based menu system for user interaction.

## Usage

### Prerequisites:
- `Leiningen` installed
- `Java` (JDK 8 or later) 

### Running from source

1. Clone Repo:

`git clone <repo>`

2. Run Application:

 `lein run`

This will launch the terminal menu interface

## Building & Running the Jar

1. Build UberJar:

`lein uberjar`

This will create a jar file in the target/uberjar directory

2. Run the jar: 

`java -jar target/uberjar/banking-simulator-0.1.0-standalone.jar`

The CLI menu will appear in the terminal.
